                            is considered one of the original espresso drinks representative of Italian espresso cuisine and eventually Italian-American espresso cuisine

                            <strong>Caffè latte</strong> is a coffee-based drink made primarily from espresso and steamed milk. It consists of one-third espresso, two-thirds heated milk and about 1cm of foam. Depending on the skill of the barista, the
                            foam can be poured in such a way to create a picture. Common pictures that appear in lattes are love hearts and ferns. Latte art is an interesting topic in itself.

                            <Stong>Caffè macchiato </Stong>is an espresso-based coffee beverage consisting mostly of coffee with a small amount of milk. Translating from the Italian phrase meaning marked coffee, this drink is made by "marking" a single shot
                            of espresso with a few drops of frothed milk and served in a demitasse. Relative to other espresso-based drinks, a caffè macchiato is closer to a straight espresso, containing substantially less milk than a cappuccino . It
                            can be used as an alternative to adding sugar to espresso, muting the bite of the espresso without adding sweetness

                            <strong>Espresso</strong> is the name of a highly concentrated, bittersweet coffee originating in Italy in the early 20th century. Translated from Italian, the word espresso refers to the speed and single-serve nature of the
                            coffee compared with slower and more communal methods of brewing coffee

                            <strong>Long Black</strong> is a beverage made by pouring a double-shot of espresso over hot water. It is commonly served in Australia and New Zealand.[1] The Long Black is different than an americano, as the former has more
                            crema than the latter. The Long Black also has a stronger flavor.

                            with up to four or five ounces of hot water in a two-demitasse cup.
